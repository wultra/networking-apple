######### USAGE #########
# This script prepares the release of the library by running the JavaScript script from Wultra infrastructure repository.
# It can be run in 3 modes:
# 1. With a version argument: it will prepare the release with the current version in the pubspec.yaml file.
#    Example: sh scripts/prepare-release.sh 1.0.0
# 2. With a version argument and --verify: it will verify that the given release version is prepared.
#    Example: sh scripts/prepare-release.sh 1.0.0 --verify
# 3. Without arguments: it will run the script in the root directory of the repository and verify that all files are prepared.
#    Example: sh scripts/prepare-release.sh
